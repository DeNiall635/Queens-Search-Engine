# Queen's Search Engine UI

This is the frontend user interface for the Queen's Search engine. The frontend allows users to input search terms and get search results back, with the search results and adverts inserted into the UI. 

## Developing

* `make` - builds the docker image.
* `make lint` - lints the codebase.
* `make run` - runs the app locally.
